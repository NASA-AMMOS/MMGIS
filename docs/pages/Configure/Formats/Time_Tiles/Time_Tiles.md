# Time Tiles

If you're serving from `/Missions`, MMGIS offers a simple in-built method for querying time-based tilesets.

## Tileset Path Structure

### Overview

A `{t}` parameter is added to the full tileset path. `.../layer/{t}/{z}/{x}/{y}.png` It is based on an ISO 9601 time but with `:` replaced with underscores and without the final `Z`.

Examples:

- /Missions/MSL/Layers/ExampleTimeTiles/2022-09-07T00_00_00Z/16/57776/31916.png
- /Missions/MSL/Layers/ExampleTimeTiles/2022-10-07T00_00_00Z/16/57776/31916.png
- /Missions/MSL/Layers/ExampleTimeTiles/2022-11-07T00_00_00Z/16/57776/31916.png

### Folder Tags

Additionally `{t}` may be appended with a name. The `time` is accessed by splitting on the new delimiter `Z-` and taking the first element.

Examples:

- /Missions/MSL/Layers/ExampleTimeTiles/2022-09-07T00_00_00Z--LosAngeles/16/57776/31916.png
- /Missions/MSL/Layers/ExampleTimeTiles/2022-10-07T00_00_00Z--NewYork/16/57776/31916.png
- /Missions/MSL/Layers/ExampleTimeTiles/2022-11-07T00_00_00Z--London/16/57776/31916.png

_Note:_ Do not change the configured url to include the appended folder name. It should remain `/{t}/`. The time folder name will be parsed accordingly and `.../{t}-LosAngeles/...` will break the path.

### Time Ranges

Time ranges are supported as well. Join start and ending times with `-to-`.

Examples:

- /Missions/MSL/Layers/ExampleTimeTiles/2022-09-07T00_00_00Z-to-2022-10-01T00_00_00Z/16/57776/31916.png
- /Missions/MSL/Layers/ExampleTimeTiles/2022-10-07T00_00_00Z-to-2022-11-01T00_00_00Z/16/57776/31916.png
- /Missions/MSL/Layers/ExampleTimeTiles/2022-11-07T00_00_00Z-to-2022-12-01T00_00_00Z--London/16/57776/31916.png

## Configuration

For a tile layer in the Layers Tab, simply:

1. Include the proper `/{t}/` parameter in its URL (see above).
2. Set `Time Enabled` to `True`.

Note: The positioning of `{t}` does offer some flexibility. Be aware though that MMGIS will scan its full directory for other times to compare too. `../{z}/{x}/{y}/{t}.png` while valid, has not been tested and may be expensive. MMGIS caches active time tile directories for 30 minutes.

In the Time Tab:

- `Enable` and make `Visible` the User Interface.

## Using

In MMGIS, expand the TimeUI bar by clicking the clock icon at the bottom right of the screen.
