## 2.11.0

_Mar 15, 2024_

#### Summary

The release adds a new tool called the ShadeTool, capable of showing visibility maps of various celestial object and craft with the aid of SPICE. The ShadeTool can reveal answers to questions like: "At this time and on my current map, what are all the locations I can view the ISS from?"

Also added are dynamic vector layers that query only for the features immediately within the map's viewport and within time ranges and zoom ranges. This enables much larger vector files to be loaded and rendered without sacrificing performance.

Additionally some new features have been added to the DrawTool, along with new layer export options and various bugfixes and improvements.
